# Chaining Commands
## Thought Process
**Chaining with Semicolons** : 
; usually works like how we use separate lines to separate commands. <br>
example : <br><br>
echo COLLEGE > PWN<br> 
cat PWN<br>
**CAN ALSO BE WRITTEN AS :** <br>
echo COLLEGE > PWN; cat PWN <br>
### Solving 
To run both /challenge/pwn and /challenge/college by chaining them in one line we can use a semicolon (;) which is the same as entering 2 commands <br>
when we press enter and a prompt occurs just that here there wont be a prompt.
#### Challenge 1
```bash
hacker@chaining~chaining-with-semicolons:~$ /challenge/pwn ; /challenge/college
Yes! You chained /challenge/pwn and /challenge/college! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{glcin_88lq8X1dGjr04Q774jwad.dVTN4QDLykTN0czW}
```
