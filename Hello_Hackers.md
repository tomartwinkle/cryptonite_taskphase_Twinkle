# Hello Hackers 
<br>

## Thought process 
The first task was simple , "Whoami" is like a who-am-i command it prints the username.
<br> </space>The Hello command would run only if its typed correctly as linux is case sensitive. 
<br>
</space>The second task used echo command. Basically the first word is the command and after it comes the arguments. 
<br>
</space>echo will output the inputs as it is. If i write echo hello ill get hello as the output. <br><br>

### solving 
first task , i used whoami to get my username and i ran the command hello. 
<br>
</space>second task, we are supposed to run the hello command not the echo command to print a single argument hackers. 
</space>so we can simply use the command hello hackers.
